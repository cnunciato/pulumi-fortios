The FortiOS provider is used to interact with the resources supported by FortiOS
and FortiManager. We need to configure the provider with the proper credentials
before it can be used.

Two products are supported now: FortiGate and FortiManager, please use the
navigation on the left to read more details about the available resources.

Detailed instructions how to configure the provider is available in the [Fortios Installation & Configuration](./installation-configuration).
